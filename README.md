Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Sotware Engineering involves designing,develping,testing and maintaining software to meet users needs.

1. It has enabled development of reliable and secure softwares helping users meet their needs.
2.  It has enhanced business sector through automation.
3.  Has driven Innovation in every sector such as Finance and Healthcare


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. Birth of Software Engineering-Brought forward in 1968 at the NATO Software Engineering Conference held to address the software crisis, where there were alot of projects delays.
2. Development of Object Oriented Programming- Object Oriented Programming introduced concepts like Encapsulation, Inheritance and Polymorphism which improved code reusability and Maintainability.
3. Agile Methodologies-The agile methodology introdced in 2001 to promote iterative development, collaboration, and flexibilty thus bringing a positive impact on Software development.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Planning-Define project scope, the objectives and feasibilty
2. Requirement Analysis- Involves gathering data including functional and non-functional requirements.
3. System Design- Creating architectural and detailed designs for the software.
4. Implementation- The actual developing of the system entailing coding
5. Testing- Validate the software through unit, integration and Acceptance testing
6. Deployment- Involves releasing the software for end users.
7. Maintenance- Maintaining the system by addressing bugs, making updates and improvements.



Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall Methodology refers to linear and Sequential approach where each phase  must be completed before moving to the next.
Agile Methodology refers to an iterative and flexible approach that allows for continous feedback and improvements.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Engineer-Designs, writes, and maintains code for software applications.
Quality Assurance Engineer- Test softwares to identify bugs and ensure functionality meets requirements.
Project Manager - Oversees the project timeline, resources, and communication between stakeholders to ensure succesful completion.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
1. IDEs- provide tools for writing, debigging, and testing code effeciently eg Visual Studio Code
2. VCS- Enables collaboration and tracking of changes in codes eg Git


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1. Managing Complexity which can be overcome by using modular design and having clear documentation.
2. Meeting Deadlines which can be solved by choosing priorities and having a better system design
3. Debugging Issues-Always write readable code which are clear.
4. Keeping up with the Technology Trend- As a Software Engineer one should engage in continous learnign and updating themselves.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1. Unit Testing- Involves testing Individual components of the software
2. Integration Testing- Ensures different modules work together correctly
3. System Testing- Ensures the whole syetem is functioning wholy.
4. Acceptance Testing- Confirms the Software meets user requirements before release.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering



Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Is the process of feeding the AI with effective prompts to ensure  optimal responses.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt. " Provide Code for fitness tracker app"
Improved Prompt. " Using html, css and Javascript provide code for a fitnees tracker app"
